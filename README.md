**CivilAI Sentinel** is a next-generation structural health monitoring tool built entirely in **Google AI Studio** using the "Vibe Coding" workflow. It leverages the advanced **multimodal reasoning capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro** to act as a pocket structural engineer, democratizing safety assessments for aging urban infrastructure.

## 🚀 The Problem
Structural failures in densely populated cities are often preceded by visible warning signs that go unnoticed by non-experts. Professional inspections are expensive, reactive, and scarce. Homeowners often cannot distinguish between:
* A harmless **shrinkage crack**.
* A dangerous **foundation settlement**.
* Critical **rebar corrosion**.

## 💡 The Solution
CivilAI Sentinel bridges the gap between raw visual data and expert engineering verdict. Instead of simple object detection, it uses Gemini 3 Pro to perform **Forensic Analysis**:
1.  **Analyze** video frames/images of building elements.
2.  **Reason** about the physics of the defect (e.g., "stair-step pattern implies soil shifting").
3.  **Diagnose** the root cause and assign a Safety Risk Score.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Causal Inference Engine
It doesn't just flag damage; it explains *why* it happened.
* **Stair-Step Cracks** → Diagnosed as **Foundation Settlement**.
* **Diagonal Cracks** → Diagnosed as **Shear Stress**.
* **Rust Stains** → Diagnosed as **Internal Corrosion**.

### 🔍 Forensic Pathology Detection
* **Spalling & Exposed Rebar:** Identifies advanced concrete degradation.
* **Efflorescence:** Detects hidden water seepage through salt deposits.
* **Thermal/Shrinkage Cracks:** Correctly identifies low-risk surface issues to prevent false alarms.

### 📊 Automated Risk Scoring
Generates an instant report card:
* 🟢 **Low Risk:** Monitoring recommended.
* 🟡 **Medium Risk:** Professional consult advised.
* 🔴 **Critical Risk:** Immediate evacuation/repair required.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built (Vibe Coding)
This project was created without writing traditional boilerplate code. Using **Google AI Studio's Build capabilities**, I engineered specific system instructions to transform Gemini 3 Pro into a civil engineering expert.

**The Tech Stack:**
* **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro (Experimental)
* **Platform:** Google AI Studio (Web Runtime)
* **Logic:** Multimodal Prompt Engineering & Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
